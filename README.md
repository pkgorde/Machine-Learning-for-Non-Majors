# Machine-Learning-for-Non-Majors

Welcome to the repository containing the teaching content I created for a class I taught earlier this year. This repository includes eight Jupyter notebooks that cover various topics in machine learning and data science.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Discussion 1: Database basics and Linear Regression
This notebook introduces the basics of databases and linear regression, providing a foundation for data storage and simple predictive modeling.

### 2. Discussion 2
This notebook covers various fundamental concepts essential for understanding more advanced topics in machine learning and data science.

### 3. Discussion 3: NumPy
This notebook focuses on NumPy, a fundamental tool for machine learning. It covers data handling using NumPy, which is essential for ML projects.

### 4. Discussion 4: The Perceptron and ANNs
This notebook introduces the perceptron and artificial neural networks (ANNs), explaining their significance and how they work.

### 5. Discussion 5: Unsupervised Learning
This notebook delves into unsupervised learning, discussing various techniques and their applications.

### 6. Discussion 6: Convolutional Neural Networks
This notebook specifically focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), explaining their structure and how they are used in image processing tasks.

### 7. Discussion 7: Decision Tree and Tree Ensembles
This notebook covers decision trees and tree ensembles, explaining their use in classification and regression tasks.

### 8. Discussion 8: Embedding models and LSTMs with Keras
This notebook discusses embedding models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks using Keras, providing insights into handling sequential data.

## How to Use
